Welcome.

Here i have some recent projects from my study path. Most are for study, including self-study from different sources + particular ones like Otus with Javarush. 

The latest one is a FlightSearcher (teamproject) - it' telegram bot which helps to find flight tickets and manage them, for additional info see:
